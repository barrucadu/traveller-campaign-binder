# Welcome, Travellers!

*Theme song: [The Lord Weird Slough Feg - Traveller - High Passage / Low Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHpfugCboI)*

You are Travellers, the rag-tag crew of a scrappy little ship, up to
your eyeballs in debt.  You don't have much, but it's something.

You make a living flitting around the sector transporting cargo and
passengers, trying to beat the interstellar market with speculative
trading, and doing odd jobs for whoever will pay---sometimes legal,
sometimes not.

## Setting

We'll use the Official Traveller Universe, specifically starting in
the [Trojan Reach sector][] (see also its [Traveller Wiki entry][] and
[Traveller Map booklet][]), probably the Sindal subsector.

I think this is a fun sector to play in because it's got a good mix of powers:

- 45% [Third Imperium][], the major human empire
- 34% [Aslan Hierate][], one of the major alien races
- 8% [Florian League][], a smaller human state
- and the rest is small [pocket empires][] or unaligned worlds

So there's lots of opportunity for tension, conflicts, and crime.

You could possibly move into one of the adjacent sectors, but a sector
is *big*.  A subsector is 10x8 hexes, and a sector is 4x4 subsectors,
so crossing a sector top-to-bottom would take 40 weeks with a Jump-1
engine, 20 weeks with a Jump-2 engine, etc, plus any time needed for
maintenance and refuelling.  Even the fastest ships, the Imperium's
X-Boats with their Jump-6 engines, would take 7 weeks to cross a full
sector.

I'll make some effort to stick to the published setting, but will make
stuff up or change things when I need to, and I won't worry about
being totally consistent.  One change I'm making is **no psionics**. I
don't like them.  Go play a fantasy game if you want magic.  There
might be mind-reading technology, but it'll be a device you have to
put your head in, not someone thinking at you.

## Party

I'd prefer for this to be a majority-human campaign: you can have
*one* alien PC if you want, but since most of the planets in the
region are human, they'll stand out a bit (and possibly be assumed to
be spies).

The two most suitable alien races would be Aslan (lion people) or
Vargr (wolf people).

I want aliens to feel alien, so here are some constraints:

- If you're a human raised in the Third Imperium you have a basic
  knowledge of the alien cultures, but probably not much detail.
- If you're an Aslan or a Vargr raised in the Third Imperium you have
  a good understanding of and tolerance for human culture.  You also
  have a good understanding of your traditional culture, but it
  doesn't necessarily influence your behaviour (e.g., an Aslan raised
  in the Third Imperium is unlikely to challenge a human to a formal
  duel over a matter of honour, unless raised in a very traditional
  family).
- If you're an Aslan or a Vargr raised in your traditional culture, it
  influences your behaviour a lot.  You have a basic understanding of
  human culture and have some tolerance for humans acting in the wrong
  way (to your eyes).

Regardless of your species, there'll be opportunities to get involved
with intrigue and politics in all of the cultures in the Trojan Reach.
Though, Aslan politics is likely to come up more frequently with an
Aslan from the Aslan Hierate in your crew.

A ship will generally need:

- a captain
- a pilot
- an astrogator
- an engineer
- a sensor operator
- a medic

You might also want:

- a steward, if you plan to take paying passengers
- a gunner, if you have ship weapons
- a marine, if you'll be getting into fights

These don't all need to be separate people, not every ship needs each
of these positions filled, and you can hire NPCs to fill any gaps;
except in space combat where you need a separate pilot and captain,
and have to have both of them, and is it any fun if an *NPC* is the
captain?

## Campaign style

At least to start with, this is going to be a pretty episodic job- or
planet-of-the-week style game, where you're doing whatever job you can
get.  For inspiration, think *Firefly*.

I plan to have a mix of genres: maybe one session it'll be horror as
you investigate a distress signal from an isolated research station;
and the next session could be a heist, with you doing some job for a
local crime boss; and the session after that might be a mystery, as
you try to clear your names of a crime you've been framed for by
finding out what really happened.

Once we've done a few of these games and you know what sort of game
you want, we'll specialise:

### The Traveller Campaign

We can just carry on as we have been, with you doing a little bit of
everything: exploring ancient alien ruins in one session, and punching
crime bosses or running from government agents in the next.

See the random mission and encounter tables in the rulebook for ideas
of what you might get up to.

### The Career Campaign

We'll focus the campaign around one or more of the careers used in
character creation.  You don't all need to have done that career, as
any organisation will have staff in a variety of roles.  For example:

- **Agent Campaign:** we'll focus on espionage, counterespionage,
  assassination, and investigation; likely to have a lot of stealth.
- **Colonist Campaign:** we'll focus on setting up new colonies and
  making them self-sustaining; likely to have more of a soap-opera
  feel.
- **Marine / Navy Campaign:** we'll focus on war, crime, and piracy;
  likely to have a lot of combat.
- **Scholar / Scout Campaign:** we'll focus on exploration, alien
  artefacts, and the unknown; likely to have a lot of macguffins.

There are lots of other careers, this list isn't exhaustive.

### The Space Pirate Campaign

Mundane jobs don't have the thrill you're looking for, you want to do
crimes.  Space crimes.  And what's the most fun sort of space crime?
Space piracy.

A space pirate campaign will focus on smuggling, blockade running,
ship-to-ship combat, dealing with crime lords, and actually a lot of
the sort of stuff you'd get up to in a Traveller Campaign, just more
illegal.

There are two ways we could flavour this:

- You arrange for a crime lord to buy out your mortgage.  You're free
  men!  Well, except for the favours he expects from you,
  indefinitely.

- You join with one of the small states dreaming of having a glorious
  interstellar empire as a privateer.  You're issued with a [letter of
  marque][] and have a safe home base, so long as you regularly commit
  acts of piracy against the enemies of the state.

Being a pirate doesn't mean you're always on the run from law
enforcement and can never interact with non-criminals.  If you adopt
fake names and identification then you'll be able to pass as
law-abiding citizens when needed, and so do other jobs too.  But be
careful nobody finds out your true identity!

Capes and dramatic gestures are mandatory.  Space pirates are
larger-than-life.

## Long-term goals

While I am planning to run a fairly episodic game, there is definitely
scope for long-term plotlines and character goals.

For example, you could:

- hire other ships and crews to work for you, forming a mercantile (or
  criminal) empire
- overthrow your patron and take over their organisation and
  underlings, becoming the new boss
- create a base of operations by hollowing out and building in an
  asteroid, or setting up your own space station
- be elevated to the nobility

You don't have to commit to a long-term goal from the start of the
campaign, but think about it.  When we specialise on a campaign style,
it'd be a shame if *nobody* had any long-term goals.

## Rules

In addition to these rule changes listed below, I'll draw upon things
from other sourcebooks which aren't rule *changes* as such, but more
rule *elaborations*, which go into more detail for how to deal with a
specific situation: like starvation, hazardous terrain, laying and
dealing with space mines, hiding inside the atmosphere of a gas giant,
or ship transponders.  These are all situational so I'll use my
judgement to decide when they apply.

We might also bring in some rules later in the campaign, for example
if someone decides they want to become a noble, we might bring in the
**Effective SOC** rules from page 9 of the *Traveller Companion*.  We
can talk about those at the time.

### Rules we are going to use

I'm not interested in running a campaign where these aren't the case.

- **Human Focus.**  There can be at most one non-human PC, and they
  must be Aslan or Vargr.

- **No Psionics.**  There is no psionics in this universe.  At all.
  Neither PC nor NPC.

### Rules I think we should use

I could be persuaded not to use these, but I think they would improve
the game.

- **Alien Upbringing** (*Aliens of Charted Space: Volume 1*).  An
  alien PC may be created using the standard rules, in which case they
  were born and raised in the Third Imperium, or created using the
  species-specific rules.

- **Allies, Contacts, Rivals, and Enemies** (*Traveller Companion*
  chapter 3).  We'll flesh out NPCs introduced in character creation
  with Affinity, Enmity, Power, Influence, and Special
  Characteristics.

- **Boon Dice.** In character creation, for two characteristics of
  your choice, roll `3d6` and discard the lowest.

### Rules we might want

Here are some rules which I think would be fun, but let's talk about
them.

- **Additional Wound Effects** (*Traveller Companion* page 49).
  Rather than being killed outright when all their physical
  characteristics are reduced to 0, Travellers and important NPCs make
  a roll modified by the circumstances of the injury to determine
  whether they die, suffer some crippling injury, or miraculously
  survive.

- **Luck** (*Traveller Companion* page 4).  A new characteristic which
  can be used to do better on skill checks.

- **Misjumps** (*Traveller Companion* page 143).  The standard rules
  for misjumps are pretty boring, let's use the variant rules.  This
  does mean that a really bad misjump could destroy the ship instantly
  or send you 36 parsecs in the wrong direction.
