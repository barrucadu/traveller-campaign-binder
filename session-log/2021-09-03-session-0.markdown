# 2021-09-03: Session 0

## Intro

> Welcome to session zero of Traveller!  Today we'll talk a bit about
> the sort of campaign we want to play, and then dive into character
> creation.  The actual game will begin next session.  I've written a
> campaign pitch, which I think you've all read, but we'll cover all
> the points in it, and some more, now.  We might overrun today, as
> character creation can take a while.

## Prep

### Pitch

- Sandbox, with scope for long-term goals
- Official Traveller Universe, starting in the Trojan Reach sector
- I'll make some effort to stick to the published setting, but won't
  necessarily be totally consistent
- No psionics
- Majority human party (or one species), one alien PC (Aslan or Vargr)
  if you want

### Discussion

#### Scheduling

- Session time & frequency
- What happens if someone can't make a session?
- Campaign length

#### Characters

- Changing characters / characters leaving the party
- Character death
- PvP (PvP isn't necessarily combat)
- Character secrets vs player secrets

#### Rules

- I expect you to know how your character works
- I have made cheatsheets for common rules
- Some parts of the game I will off-load entirely to you (eg, trade)
- Alternative rules:
  - No psionics
  - Character creation:
    - Alternative character creation rules for alien PCs raised in their
      native cultures
    - Luck (*TC* page 4)
    - Boon Dice (*TC* page 11)
    - Allies, Contacts, Rivals, and Enemies (*TC* chapter 3)
  - Mechanics:
    - Additional Wound Effects (*TC* page 49)
    - Misjumps (*TC* page 143)
    - + whatever situational rules I think should apply

#### Metagaming

- Reduction of "planning in-character actions out-of-character, when
  there's no opportunity in-character to do so" (discussing combat
  strategy in the middle of a round, or talking about what to say to
  an NPC when they're right next to you, or sharing information when
  the characters are not together --- rules questions, clarifying
  character knowledge, etc, are all fine)
